## Inspiration

An important first step in saving the environment is to know how our actions impact it.

## What it does

Allows the user to input common activities to get a personalized carbon footprint calculation.

## How I built it

Used Java and Android Studio to create a simple and clean design.

## Challenges I ran into

Getting the the Android emulator to run at a sufficient speed on my laptop with relatively low processing power.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Created a sleek helper function that eliminated what would have been a lot of redundant code.

## What I learned

How to use a third party Android emulator.

## What's next for Carbon Footprint

Allow daily, monthly, and yearly tracking. Add dynamic visualization.
